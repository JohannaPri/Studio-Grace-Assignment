# The Lemon's Music Quiz

*This was a group assignment in the course Graphic design at the Front End Development program at Medieinstitutet Stockholm.*

In this project we made a design of a web aplication in Figma, and then switched design with another group. Our task was then to develop the design that we received from the other group.
